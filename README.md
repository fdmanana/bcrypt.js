# bcrypt.js

This is a JavaScript implementation of the OpenBSD's bcrypt password
hashing method.

This method is adaptable to future processor performance improvements,
allowing the possibility of increasing the time for verifying a
password hash while maintaining compatibility with older password hashes.

This implementation is a backport of the C implementation by Solar
Designer <solar at openwall.com>
